                                "I remember starting at the Merlin and being immediately intimidated by how well organised Sue was. It was my first teaching role and Sue appeared to me to be someone already familiar with the school, to understand Jane Addis and her idiosyncratic approach, and know how to win respect and love from staff and students alike. She breezed in (or was already there) each morning and her classroom was immaculate, work displayed neatly, lessons planned to perfection. I suppose I don't know if this was all actually the case, or she was winging it a bit more like the rest of us, however, to me, she seemed effortlessly professional and smart. During breaks she was the one to talk to, the one with the funny anecdotes and interesting and intelligent observations. I learnt a lot from being on the staff with Sue and she was always happy to share advice and help. The Sue, in my memory, has endless energy and enthusiasm, is competitive and ambitious, and knows a lot about a lot. Fiercely proud of her boys and very family focused. She was always great fun in and out of school, quick to laugh and full of wit. Even though we haven't seen each other for many years I feel I'm very lucky to know her and be able to call her a friend."

Such a rarity to find someone who was brave enough to inspire such young kids with what others would believe to be too complicated for them at that age.

He has excelled in science and still loves the subject and everything it offers. Science Sue's passion for everything science definitely set him off on the path to being a positive and engaged scientist. If professional rugby player doesn't happen, it's definitely something he really enjoys. 😉 That along with history and Latin! Seb only had a short year with you all but has such fond memories. He says he always looked forward to going up the stairs to see Science Sue and her lessons. He has a great grasp of everything science too and always gets good feedback. He got 86% for his first proper test from his forces module...! From our point of view Science Sue was such a positive and happy teacher who demonstrated her passion for Science and teaching in everything she did. The plays the children put on were always such fun with everyone managing to do something with a smile on their faces. The children clearly loved and respected her and knew she always meant business in her lessons. Not a skill to be underestimated! Thanks for your energy and enthusiasm and many happy returns!"

                                <h2>My Educational Philosophy</h2>
                                <p>
                                    I believe that every student has the potential to excel in education when provided 
                                    with the right guidance, support, and learning environment. My approach combines 
                                    rigorous academic standards with engaging, practical methods that make complex 
                                    scientific concepts accessible and enjoyable.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    With over 35 years of experience in science education, I have had the privilege 
                                    of helping hundreds of students discover their passion for learning 
                                    and achieve their academic goals.
                                </p>

                                <h3>My Approach</h3>

                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Personalized Learning:</strong> Every student learns differently. 
                                        I adapt my teaching methods to match individual learning styles and pace.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Practical Application:</strong> Education comes alive when students 
                                        can see real-world applications and conduct hands-on experiments.
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <strong>Building Confidence:</strong> I focus on building students' 
                                        confidence through positive reinforcement and achievable goals.
                                    </li>

                                        <strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Beyond memorization, I encourage 
                                        students to question, analyze, and think critically about educational concepts.
                                    </li>
