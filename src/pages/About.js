              <h2>My Educational Philosophy</h2>
              <p>
                I believe that every student has the potential to excel in science when provided 
                with the right guidance, support, and learning environment. My approach combines 
                rigorous academic standards with engaging, practical methods that make complex 
                scientific concepts accessible and enjoyable.
              </p>

              <p>
                With over 15 years of experience in science education, I have had the privilege 
                of helping hundreds of students discover their passion for scientific learning 
                and achieve their academic goals. From struggling beginners to advanced students 
                preparing for university entrance, I tailor my teaching methods to meet each 
                student's unique needs and learning style.
              </p>

              <h3>My Approach</h3>
              <ul className="approach-list">
                <li>
                  <strong>Personalized Learning:</strong> Every student learns differently. 
                  I adapt my teaching methods to match individual learning styles and pace.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Practical Application:</strong> Science comes alive when students 
                  can see real-world applications and conduct hands-on experiments.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Building Confidence:</strong> I focus on building students' 
                  confidence through positive reinforcement and achievable goals.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Critical Thinking:</strong> Beyond memorization, I encourage 
                  students to question, analyze, and think critically about scientific concepts.
