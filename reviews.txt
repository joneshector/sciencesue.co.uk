Rumour has it, that there was quite a good music teacher in the school but the science teacher was miles better!! 🤣 
Joking aside, my children came back with brilliant stories of the inspirational science and drama lessons by Sue, clearly taking in what was taught.

In our science-loving family, Sue turned curiosity into joy. Esa and Zia adored her lessons — she makes discovery feel like magic and learning feel like love. Just thinking about Science Sue makes us all smile at home!

Science Sue, you were a great teacher and taught me a lot.
We had a lot of fun l look much different now. We have had so much fun together and every year passes by so fast!

Science Sue, thank you for being such a great teacher. I’ll never forget how entertaining your classes were. I also have fond memories of acting in your plays, especially playing the pig in the brick house in Roald Dahl’s Revolting Rhymes! 
- Tom Monaghan (Student)


Science Sue! Thank you being such an inspirational science teacher and for putting on some truly memorable plays. I have vivid memories of taking stage falls as Detective Fix in Around the World in Eighty Days!

Science Sue transformed science from a subject into an adventure through her passion, creativity, and kindness. She inspired Alex and Oli to be curious and confident—a teacher who truly left her mark.

Sue is an inspirational teacher. Her science lessons are fun, relevant and highly interactive! Sue has an ability to engage children from their very first lesson in Reception all the way through to the thrill of the Year 3 leavers Science Party! Every lesson is carefully developed so that each child, while working within their ability, is challenged to extend their understanding. It was a privilege to work alongside Sue and see the children come away from their science lessons brimming with joy, full of knowledge and a feeling of achievement.

What a pleasure to have had my boys taught by Science Sue.
Sue has the gift of making learning fun and exciting. Every day my boys would come home from school animatedly sharing what they had learnt with Science Sue that day.
I am extremely grateful for Sue inspiring their love of science.
- Jenny Masters (Parent)


Science Sue made a big impact on me and my two brothers, who were also taught by her. 
She had this amazing way of making science come alive - always getting us to explore, question, and discover things for ourselves. Those lessons have stuck with me ever since, and I’ll always be grateful to her!
- Rory Hugill (Student)


Science Sue was the teacher who first made science come alive for me. Her enthusiasm and practical approach turned every lesson into an adventure. I don’t think I’d have gone on to study Natural Sciences at university if it hadn’t been for her inspiration and encouragement at an early age!

How well we remember your energy in daily greetings at the school gate;
Even on dark winter days your smile would light your magical science room and chemistry we would create.
We seemed to defy gravity when were selected for the top table and of course the Goslet awards!
These were the things that mattered to us and magnetised the Merlin crew;
You shine so bright that Galileo Galilei would have named one of the stars on the Merlin Hat as “Sirius Sue”.
You set many forces in motion and we are still giving it a go: Heath is the science prize winner at Warwick Academy!
