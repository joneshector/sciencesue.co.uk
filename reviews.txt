Sue is an inspiration to children and colleagues alike, with her creative flair and think-outside-the-box approach in helping children become the very best versions of themselves - both academically and more widely. We are truly lucky to have Science Sue, and so appreciate all she brings to school life, both in and out of the classroom.

Science Sue's teaching is effervescent.  
She understands young minds in their infinite variety, and how to get the best out of them.  
Sue's love of science shines through her lessons; she makes exploring and learning a fascinating process.  
Her pupils are engaged and animated by Sue's enthusiasm, and so they work hard to succeed.  
- Victoria Cross (Teacher)


I remember starting at the Merlin and being immediately intimidated by how well organised Sue was. It was my first teaching role and Sue appeared to me to be someone already familiar with the school, to understand Jane Addis and her idiosyncratic approach, and know how to win respect and love from staff and students alike. She breezed in (or was already there) each morning and her classroom was immaculate, work displayed neatly, lessons planned to perfection. I suppose I don’t know if this was all actually the case, or she was winging it a bit more like the rest of us, however, to me, she seemed effortlessly professional and smart. During breaks she was the one to talk to, the one with the funny anecdotes and interesting and intelligent observations. I learnt a lot from being on the staff with Sue and she was always happy to share advice and help. The Sue, in my memory, has endless energy and enthusiasm, is competitive and ambitious, and knows a lot about a lot. Fiercely proud of her boys and very family focused. She was always great fun in and out of school, quick to laugh and full of wit. 
Even though we haven’t seen each other for many years I feel I’m very lucky to know her and be able to call her a friend.

Sue is an engaging teacher who always inspires children to reach their full potential while developing confidence and pride in their achievements. Science topics come alive with relatable, exciting links and self-discovery. A joy to work with; supportive, funny and so creative.
- Miranda (Teacher)


Sue is an inspirational teacher. Her science lessons are fun, relevant and highly interactive! Sue has an ability to engage children from their very first lesson in Reception all the way through to the thrill of the Year 3 leavers Science Party! Every lesson is carefully developed so that each child, while working within their ability, is challenged to extend their understanding. It was a privilege to work alongside Sue and see the children come away from their science lessons brimming with joy, full of knowledge and a feeling of achievement.
- Niki Mayor (Teacher)


Rumour has it, that there was quite a good music teacher in the school but the science teacher was miles better!! 🤣 
Joking aside, my children came back with brilliant stories of the inspirational science and drama lessons by Sue, clearly taking in what was taught. 
- Ben Prest (Parent)


In our science-loving family, Sue turned curiosity into joy. Esa and Zia adored her lessons — she makes discovery feel like magic and learning feel like love. Just thinking about Science Sue makes us all smile at home!
- Sheeba & Aadil (Parents)


Science Sue, you were a great teacher and taught me a lot.
We had a lot of fun l look much different now. We have had so much fun together and every year passes by so fast!
- Mila Ucer (Student)


Science Sue, thank you for being such a great teacher. I’ll never forget how entertaining your classes were. I also have fond memories of acting in your plays, especially playing the pig in the brick house in Roald Dahl’s Revolting Rhymes! 
- Tom Monaghan (Student)


Science Sue! Thank you being such an inspirational science teacher and for putting on some truly memorable plays. I have vivid memories of taking stage falls as Detective Fix in Around the World in Eighty Days!
- William Monaghan (Student)


Science Sue transformed science from a subject into an adventure through her passion, creativity, and kindness. She inspired Alex and Oli to be curious and confident—a teacher who truly left her mark.
- The Bamfords (Parents)


What a pleasure to have had my boys taught by Science Sue.
Sue has the gift of making learning fun and exciting. Every day my boys would come home from school animatedly sharing what they had learnt with Science Sue that day.
I am extremely grateful for Sue inspiring their love of science.
- Jenny Masters (Parent)


Science Sue made a big impact on me and my two brothers, who were also taught by her. 
She had this amazing way of making science come alive - always getting us to explore, question, and discover things for ourselves. Those lessons have stuck with me ever since, and I’ll always be grateful to her!
- Rory Hugill (Student)


Science Sue was the teacher who first made science come alive for me. Her enthusiasm and practical approach turned every lesson into an adventure. I don’t think I’d have gone on to study Natural Sciences at university if it hadn’t been for her inspiration and encouragement at an early age!
- Chris Hines (Student)

How well we remember your energy in daily greetings at the school gate;
Even on dark winter days your smile would light your magical science room and chemistry we would create.
We seemed to defy gravity when were selected for the top table and of course the Goslet awards!
These were the things that mattered to us and magnetised the Merlin crew;
You shine so bright that Galileo Galilei would have named one of the stars on the Merlin Hat as “Sirius Sue”.
You set many forces in motion and we are still giving it a go: Heath is the science prize winner at Warwick Academy!
- Heath (Student)


Science Sue the backbone and beating heart of Merlin School. She knew every child, not just by name, but knew them well - their strengths and their fears. She inspired and encouraged in science lessons. She boosted creativity and confidence by writing and designing the most original drama plays. Always working incredibly hard behind the scenes. Devoted, passionate and Inspired.

Science/Drama Sue! Hope you have a wonderful day and are thoroughly celebrated as you very much deserve to be. Thank you for all of your amazing contributions. You have shaped and inspired so many young minds - something to be very proud of.  We still say are you sitting on your Botticellis and your and Mrs Prest’s wonderful videos got us through lockdown!!
With so much love and warmest birthday wishes from The Finlays
- Sally, Neil, James and Emily


Science Sue ! What an amazing inspirational teacher! I have no doubt she had a huge influence on James and James’s love of science. Such a rarity to find someone who was brave enough to inspire such young kids with what others would believe to be too complicated for them at that age. I remember james also telling me that he dominated the interview at colet court telling Mr Meunier all about the heart dissection! 🤣 just brilliant.
- James and James


Science Sue!  How much fun you made learning and the exciting activities we did!!!! One of which being the study of the eye. I remember being blindfolded and you gave us raw, peeled tomatoes, and had to poke our fingers in them to work out what we were about to study! We all thought were real eyeballs!! Such a fun way to learn and something I remember very fondly.
Equally the amazing plays you directed which definitely added to my love of performing that has not wavered since and I’m now studying at university.

Science Sue
In your mysterious laboratory, we learnt some very interesting things - who used mentos and coke in science lessons? Sue did…..to show us chemical reactions and the release of gas from the coke bottle! And we parachuted eggs out of windows to find out about gravity and air resistance! Great fun and still remembered!
Also, to put a pea size amount of toothpaste on your toothbrush for heathy teeth! 🦷!
And of course, we learnt to sit on our ‘botticelli’s’ correctly! 😆
Thanks Science Sue! Great fun! 
- Marcus


An epic drama and science prof!
Happy 60th Birthday Sue

Dearest Science Sue
Wishing you a very happy 60th birthday from all the Fewings ! Hoping there’s not too much resting on your Botticelli on the big day ! So many wonderful memories shared amongst the whole family of your inspirational teaching and humour ! Cocoa cola stripping a 2 p piece and what must it be doing to your gut - you should have been on National TV -it would have saved our nation’s gut , teeth and money !Except maybe best kept secret, were your dance moves wearing a crash helmet 🤣!
With lots of love from us all for a wonderful 60th birthday !

Science Sue was such an inspiring teacher. I still remember the hilarious lesson when she tricked us into holding skinned tomatoes (with blindfolds) pretending they were eye balls… always brilliant fun and dramatic teaching. I’m now doing A-Level Biology!
- Agatha (Student)


Science Sue’s eagle eyes catch every detail, and her legendary dissection lesson inspires curiosity and confidence. With engaging experiments and genuine passion, she turns science into an exciting, hands-on journey that students never forget.

Science Sue!
Romeo — is now 14 and mysteriously 6’3”, which shocks us too! 
He remembers every topic that set his brain buzzing,
and how the whole class prayed for a Science Superstar sticker… a badge he earned and still treasures thanks to you.
You taught that energy never disappears —
Much like your patience through the years.
And though you’re sixty (don’t panic… stay calm),
You’re still more stable than sodium in a palm.
So here’s to you, our science star,
Still glowing hotter than a quasar.
May your birthday be a grand breakthrough…
Happy 60th, brilliant Science Sue! 🧪✨

Science Sue has been an incredible inspiration to our son, Theo. Her energy, passion, and creativity sparked his curiosity and have certainly made science his favourite subject. Thank you for sowing the seeds of joy for learning.
- Clare & Stuart Bedford (Parents)


Both our boys absolutely love science and remember Merlin very fondly. Monty specifically after his very special four years with you all. He has excelled in science and still loves the subject and everything it offers. Science Sue's passion for everything science definitely set him off on the path to being a positive and engaged scientist. If professional rugby player doesn't happen, it's definitely something he really enjoys. 😉 That along with history and Latin! 
Seb only had a short year with you all but has such fond memories. He says he always looked forward to going up the stairs to see Science Sue and her lessons. He has a great grasp of everything science too and always gets good feedback. He got 86% for his first proper test from his forces module...! 
From our point of view Science Sue was such a positive and happy teacher who demonstrated her passion for Science and teaching in everything she did. The plays the children put on were always such fun with everyone managing to do something with a smile on their faces.  The children clearly loved and respected her and knew she always meant business in her lessons. Not a skill to be underestimated! Thanks for your energy and enthusiasm and many happy returns!
